Subject: XML Feed Issue - Validation Passes but System Errors

Dear Team,

I've attached an XML example with 1 object and the schema I used for validation.

**Validation Result**: âœ… PASSED - No errors found
- XML validator confirms the feed is 100% compliant with AdMarkt schema
- All required fields present and correctly formatted
- Data types and constraints satisfied

**Problem**: Your system immediately throws an error upon feed upload, despite perfect validation.

**Question**: How would you prefer us to store/host this XML feed? 
- Our current servers (Render hosting) seem inaccessible to your system
- Cloudinary links also appear blocked
- What hosting solution or delivery method works best for your integration?

Please advise on the optimal XML feed delivery approach for your system.

Best regards,
Ross
